import requests
Here are the optimized versions of the code:

1. In the `SearchQueryAnalyzer` class , you can directly access the values from the analysis result dictionary instead of accessing them through index.

```python


def analyze_search_query(self, query):
    analysis = self.nlp(query)
    entities = analysis[0]['entity']
    topics = analysis[0]['topic']
    sentiment = analysis[0]['sentiment']
    return entities, topics, sentiment


```
Fix:
```python


def analyze_search_query(self, query):
    analysis = self.nlp(query)
    entities = analysis[0]['entity']
    topics = analysis[0]['topic']
    sentiment = analysis[0]['sentiment']
    return entities, topics, sentiment


```


2. In the `WebPageRetriever` class , you can directly import the `get` function from the `requests` module instead of importing the whole module.

```python
```
